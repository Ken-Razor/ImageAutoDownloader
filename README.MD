# Media Auto Downloader üöÄ

A Node.js script that automatically scrapes and downloads all images and videos from a given webpage. It uses `puppeteer-core` to control a headless browser, ensuring that even dynamically loaded content is captured.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Comprehensive Media Scraping**: Finds and downloads images (JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF, SVG, AVIF) and videos (MP4, WEBM, MOV, OGG, etc.).
* **Dynamic Content Handling**: Scrolls the entire page and waits for lazy-loaded elements to ensure all media is discovered.
* **Smart URL Discovery**: Captures media from `<img>` tags, `<video>` tags, `srcset` attributes, and CSS `background-image` properties.
* **Organized Downloads**: Saves all media into a timestamped folder named after the website, with separate subdirectories for `images` and `videos`.
* **Flexible Browser Support**: Automatically finds an existing installation of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. It also allows you to specify a custom path to any Chromium-based browser.
* **Detailed Logging**: Provides an optional `DETAILED_LOGGING` mode to troubleshoot network requests and save a detailed log file.
* **User-Friendly**: Interactive command-line interface with clear, bilingual (English and Chinese) instructions.
* **Robust Downloading**: Includes progress indicators for large files and handles both standard URLs and Base64 data URIs.

## üìã Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Required to run the JavaScript code. (Version 14.x or newer is recommended).
2.  **A Chromium-based Browser**: The script needs a browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or a similar alternative. The script will try to find it automatically.
3.  **NPM (or Yarn)**: Node Package Manager, which comes bundled with Node.js, is used to install dependencies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Get the code**:
    Save the script code into a file named `index.js`.

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Open a terminal in the directory where you saved `index.js` and run the following command to install the necessary Node.js packages:
    ```bash
    npm install puppeteer-core
    ```

## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Run the Script**:
    Execute the script from your terminal using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

2.  **Enter the URL**:
    The script will prompt you to enter the full URL of the webpage you want to scrape.
    ```
    ‚úî Enter the page URL to scrape media (ËæìÂÖ•Ë¶ÅÊäìÂèñÂ™í‰ΩìÁöÑÁΩëÂùÄ): [https://example.com](https://example.com)
    ```

3.  **Let the Magic Happen**:
    The script will launch a headless browser, navigate to the URL, scroll through the page, collect all media links, and download them.

4.  **Find Your Files**:
    Once finished, all downloaded media will be located in a newly created folder in the same directory as the script. The folder will be named like `media-example.com-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS-SSSZ`.

## üîß Configuration (Optional)
You can customize the script's behavior by creating a `config.txt` file in the same directory as the script.

Create a file named `config.txt` and add the following options as needed:

```ini
# Set to true to enable detailed network logging for debugging purposes.
# This will create a log file with every network request.
DETAILED_LOGGING=false

# If the script cannot find your browser, or if you want to use a specific
# portable browser, provide the full path to its executable here.
# IMPORTANT: Use double backslashes (\\) for paths in Windows.
CUSTOM_BROWSER_PATH=C:\\Path\\To\\Your\\Browser\\chrome.exe
Example config.txt:
Ini, TOML

DETAILED_LOGGING=true
CUSTOM_BROWSER_PATH=C:\\Program Files\\BraveSoftware\\Brave-Browser\\Application\\brave.exe

```
